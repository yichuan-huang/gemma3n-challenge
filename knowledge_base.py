Please observe the items in the image carefully according to the above classification standards. If the image shows garbage/waste items, provide accurate garbage classification results. If the image does NOT show garbage/waste (e.g., people, living things, functioning items), classify it as "Unable to classify" and explain why it's not garbage.

Format your response EXACTLY as follows:

**Classification**: [Category Name or "Unable to classify"]
**Reasoning**: [Brief explanation of why this item belongs to this category, or why it cannot be classified as garbage]
