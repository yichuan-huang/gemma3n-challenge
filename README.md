# Waste Classification Application

This project is a web-based application that classifies waste materials from user-uploaded images. It identifies the type of waste (e.g., cardboard, glass, metal) and provides information on how to properly dispose of it.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Image-based classification:** Upload an image of a waste item to have it automatically classified.
* **Multiple waste categories:** The application can identify a variety of waste materials.
* **Disposal information:** After classification, the app provides guidance on how to dispose of the identified waste material.
* **Web interface:** A user-friendly web interface built with Gradio makes the application easy to use.

## üí° How it works

The application uses a pre-trained Gemma3n(E2B) model to perform the image classification. The model has been fine-tuned on a dataset of waste images to accurately identify different materials. The disposal information is retrieved from a knowledge base within the application.
